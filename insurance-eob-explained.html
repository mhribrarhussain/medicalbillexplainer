            <h1>Understanding Your Explanation of Benefits (EOB)</h1>
            <p class="subtitle" style="font-size: 1.25rem;">It looks like a bill, it says "This is not a bill," and it's confusing. Here is how to read it.</p>

                <h2>The Golden Rule of EOBs</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: bold; color: var(--primary-color);">Never pay a medical bill until you have compared it with your Insurance EOB.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The EOB tells you exactly what your insurance company agreed to pay and exactly what you owe. If the hospital bill says you owe $500, but your EOB says "Patient Responsibility: $100," <strong>you only owe $100.</strong></p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Billed Amount</h3>
                    <p>This is the "sticker price" the doctor or hospital charged. It is usually very high and almost made up. You rarely pay this amount if you have insurance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Allowed Amount</h3>
                    <p><strong>This is the real price.</strong> It is the negotiated rate your insurance company promised to pay the doctor. The doctor cannot charge you the difference between the Billed Amount and the Allowed Amount (this is called "Balance Billing" and is usually illegal for in-network providers).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Deductible</h3>
                    <p>The amount you must pay 100% of out of your own pocket before your insurance starts sharing the cost. If your deductible is $1,000, you pay the first $1,000 of medical bills each year.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Coinsurance</h3>
                    <p>Your share of the cost <em>after</em> you meet your deductible. Common splits are 80/20 (Insurance pays 80%, you pay 20%).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Copay</h3>
                    <p>A flat fee you pay for specific visits (e.g., $25 for a family doctor, $150 for ER). Copays usually do not count toward your deductible.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Patient Responsibility</h3>
                    <p><strong>The Bottom Line.</strong> This is the total amount you owe the doctor. It is the sum of your Deductible + Coinsurance + Copay. </p>
