            <p>Don't panic. Many medical bills contain errors. Follow these steps to verify and dispute your charges.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Step 1: Get an Itemized Bill</h2>
                <p>Never pay a summary bill that just says "Lab Services: $500".</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Call the hospital billing department and say: <br><em>"Please send me a detailed, itemized statement with CPT codes for every charge."</em></p>
                <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">This prevents them from hiding "fluff" charges.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Step 2: Check for Duplicate Charges</h2>
                <p>Look at your itemized bill. Do you see the same CPT code listed twice for the same day?</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Being charged for a "Tylenol" pill 5 times when you only took one.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Step 3: Ensure In-Network Status</h2>
                <p>Did your insurance pay nothing because they claim the doctor was "Out of Network"?</p>
                <p>If you went to an In-Network Hospital, the <strong>No Surprises Act (2022)</strong> protects you from surprise bills from out-of-network doctors (like anesthesiologists or radiologists) at that facility.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Action:</strong> Call your insurance and ask: "Does the No Surprises Act apply to this claim?"</p>

        <section class="section">
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Step 4: Ask for Financial Aid</h2>
                <p>Non-profit hospitals are REQUIRED by law to have Financial Assistance Policies (Charity Care).</p>
                <p>Even if you have a job and insurance, you might qualify if the bill is a large percentage of your income.</p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Google "[Hospital Name] Financial Assistance Application".</li>
                    <li>Call usage ask: "I would like to apply for charity care or financial assistance."</li>
                    <li>Ask for a "Cash Pay Discount" if you can pay a lump sum immediately (often 20-30% off).</li>
                </ul>

                <ul style="list-style: none;">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">📞 "I am looking at my bill and see CPT code X. Can you explain exactly what service this charge is for?"</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">📞 "Ideally, I would like to pay this off. Do you offer a prompt-pay discount?"</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">📞 "I see a charge for 'Room and Board' but I was only in the waiting room. Can you review this?"</li>
