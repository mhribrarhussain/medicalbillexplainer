                    <p>This code is frequently confusing for patients. Sometimes it appears as a separate line item from the main procedure, or it might be a "facility fee" component. Always ask for an itemized bill to see exactly what this charge covers.</p>

                    <p>Most standard insurance plans cover Established Patient Office Visit (Level 4) when deemed medically necessary. However, you may still owe a copay or coinsurance depending on your specific plan's deductible status.</p>

                    <summary>What if I was charged more than $220?</summary>
                    <p>If your bill is significantly higher than the typical range, you can call the billing department and ask for an explanation. You can also compare the price to the "Medicare Allowable" rate for your area to see if the charge is excessive.</p>
